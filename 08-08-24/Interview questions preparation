1. What is a SQL View?

A SQL View is a virtual table based on the result of a query. 
It does not store data itself, but instead provides a simplified way to access complex data. 
Views can be used to simplify queries, hide sensitive data, and improve data security.

2. What is a Sub Query?

A Sub Query, also known as a nested query or inner query, is a query nested inside another query. 
The inner query is executed first, and its results are used by the outer query. 
Subqueries can be used to retrieve data that meets certain conditions.

3. What is the purpose of an Aggregate Function?

An Aggregate Function performs calculations on a set of values and returns a single value. 
Examples of aggregate functions include SUM, AVG, MAX, MIN, and COUNT. 
These functions are used to summarize data and provide insights.

4. What is the difference between an INNER JOIN and a LEFT JOIN?

An INNER JOIN returns only the rows that have matching values in both tables, 
while a LEFT JOIN returns all rows from the left table and the matching rows from the right table. 
If there are no matches, the result will contain NULL values.

5. What is a Scalar Sub Query?

A Scalar Sub Query is a subquery that returns a single value. 
It can be used in a query to perform calculations or retrieve data that meets certain conditions.

6. What is the purpose of a GROUPING SETS clause?

A GROUPING SETS clause is used to group data by one or more columns and perform aggregations on each group. 
It allows you to perform multiple aggregations in a single query.

7. What is a FULL OUTER JOIN?

A FULL OUTER JOIN returns all rows from both tables, with NULL values in the columns where there are no matches. 
It combines the results of a LEFT JOIN and a RIGHT JOIN.

8. Can a View be used to update data?

No, a View cannot be used to update data directly. 
However, you can update the underlying tables that the View is based on, and the changes will be reflected in the View.

9. What is the difference between a Sub Query and a Join?

A Sub Query is used to retrieve data that meets certain conditions, while a Join is used to combine data from two or more tables based on a common column.

10. What is the purpose of a CROSS JOIN?

A CROSS JOIN returns the Cartesian product of both tables, 
with each row of one table combined with each row of the other table. 
It is used to combine data from two tables that do not have a common column.
